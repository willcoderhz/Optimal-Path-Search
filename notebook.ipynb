    "### Grading\n",
    "\n",
    "Points for each section are awarded based on finding the most optimal path (for that search algorithm) and then evaluating the number of nodes explored. To track the number of times a node is explored during the search, the `ExplorableGraph` wrapper is used on the networkx Graph class. Every time you process a node, by calling `graph.neighbors(node)`, the count for that node increases by one. You will need to use one of these methods to add a node's neighbors to the search queue, just be careful not to call it unnecessarily throughout your code. We have created the `graph.get_edge_weight(u, v)` method to be used to access edge weights between two nodes, `u` and `v`. All other normal `networkx` graph operations can be performed. Exercise specific details can be found in the exercise descriptions below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Helper Files\n",
    "\n",
    "While you'll only have to edit the files in the `submission` folder and submit those files to Gradescope, there are a number of other notable files:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `notebook.ipynb`: This notebook where you can run our generously provided local tests on your search algorithms.\n",
    "2. `search_basic_tests.py`: Sample basic tests, visualizes the Romania graph.\n",
    "3. `search_submission_tests_grid.py`: Visualizes the search as a grid.\n",
    "4. `search_romania_tests.py`: More comprehensive tests on the Romania graph than `search_basic_tests`.\n",
    "5. `search_atlanta_tests.py`: Tests for the Atlanta graph.\n",
    "6. `search_case_visualizer.py`: For visualizing specific failed cases of interest on the Romania graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to play around with provided tests above and to write your own for more comprehensive testing. See the README file for details on how to run them, and open those specific files for more details."

    "## Frequently Asked Questions <a name=\"faq\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "> **General**\n",
    "> 1. Do **NOT** create a copy of the graph structure for any of the algorithms or computations. We refer to this as \"caching neighbors\" and it is illegal.\n",
    "> 2. A walkthrough video will be released with the assignment release on Edstem. It is highly recommended that you watch the video for guidance on how to get started on the project as well as tips for individual exercises.\n",
    "> 3. This is a difficult assignment! Get started early, use office hours, and don't give up!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Error Messages (Gradescope and Local)**\n",
    "> 1. **NoneType object is not subscriptable** - This usually occurs when you return a path that is not completely connected (a pair of successive nodes in your path are not connected) or if your path returned is empty when it is not supposed to be empty.\n",
    "> 2. **Path does not go from start to goal or is invalid** - (Gradescope) The path returned by your algorithm does not have the start and end goals at their respective positions; does not have the correct start and end goals; is not the shortest path to the goal; or is not a complete/connected path.\n",
    "> 3. **Path is longer than optimal path** - (Gradescope) Your path cost is greater than the expected optimal path cost/benchmark.\n",
    "> 4. **Nodes explored should be from a valid frontier and should be kept to a minimum** - (Gradescope) Your algorithm is exploring more nodes than necessary or is exploring nodes that should not be explored in that particular test. This is independent of whether or not your path is correct.\n",
    "> 5. **On average for the failed test case(s), excluding cases where path is longer than optimal: \n",
    "number of nodes explored more than the benchmark = xyz** - (Gradescope) The average number of nodes explored in excess by your algorithm (includes only cases where path was optimal)\n",
    "> 6. **Path cost is incorrect** - (Gradescope) The cost of your path is incorrect.\n",
    "> 7. **List index was out of range** - (Gradescope) This is likely due to the fact that your code may not be generalized properly. While we provide the Romania map for local testing, the map on Gradescope is not identical and node labels may not be one character strings. (i.e. multicharacter strings, integers, floats, etc.) Make sure your code is generalized!\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Grading**\n",
    "> 1. **The grade you see in Gradecope is the grade that you will get, unless an OSI violation is detected**. In the event that an OSI violation is detected, you will be notified at some point after the assignment closure for administrative steps. So please, check with teaching staff before you do anything that might result in an OSI violation.\n",
    "> 2. **Are in-person and OMSCS folk graded together?** No. They are two separate sections.\n",
    "> 3. **Gradescope automatically marks your most recent submission as the one for grading**. Make sure you activate your best submission for grading before the final deadline.\n",
    "> 4. The autograder is set to timeout in **10 minutes**, so if your submissions runs for longer than 10 minutes it will be terminated and not graded. Note that in some cases, this will fail to occur due to infinite loops or memory overflow, in which case you will have crased the autograder and should reach on Edstem to see if the teaching staff can manually terminate the autograder for you.\n",
    "> 5. You are allowed a maximum of **2 submissions** within a rolling **30 minute window**. Please use your submissions wisely."

    "A common data structure used in search algorithms is the **Priority Queue**, often used to identify which path to investigate next, prioritizing shorter paths in hopes of finding the shortest path from a source to a destination. In this exercise, we ask you to implement a Priority Queue that takes on elements in the form of a tuple: `(priority, payload)`, where elements with a higher priority (in our case a smaller value) should be removed first, and if two elements have the same priority, the element that joined the queue earlier should be removed first (FIFO ordering). The file for you to edit and submit to Gradescope is `submission/priority_queue.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common implementation of a Priority Queue is via a *Binary Heap*. Binary heaps are a popular option because they provide *amortized $O(1)$ insertion and $O(\\log(n))$ removal time*. To pass our tests, your Priority Queue must perform better than the naive implementation in our tests (`InsertionSortQueue`), which sorts the entire list after every insertion. We recommend looking at the Python documentation for their [`heapq` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) for inspiration if you are stuck, although please do your best to try to figure it out on your own.\n",

    "> 2. Implement the functions `pop` and `append` in the PriorityQueue class at a minimum. You can add extra helper functions within the class if you'd like and you may also implement `remove` if you find that necessary.\n",
    "> 3. Preserve FIFO. It is possible for the priority queue to receive two elements with the same priority. In the event that that occurs, the element that joined the priority queue first should be returned first. The best hint we can give you is to think about using some sort of a counter to keep track of when each node joined the Priority Queue...\n",
    "> 4. Generalize. The nodes provided to the priority queue will be Python tuples in the form of `(priority, payload)`. You may assume that the datatype for `priority` is a standard Python datatype (i.e. `int`, `float`, `str`, etc.). The `payload` can be of any datatype (standard or custom).\n",

    "> 1. **Are there multiple correct paths possible?** No. If you follow the above instructions, each pair of start and goal nodes will result in a unique solution.\n",
    "> 2. **Do I need Priority Queue for this?** No. BFS does not need to use a priority queue, a simple FIFO queue using a Python `list` should be sufficient. You may use your priority queue implementation if you'd like, it should also work.\n",
    "> 3. **Why does it say I don't have the right path when my true path cost is shorter?** Remember, BFS treats all edges as having a cost of 1, so the true path cost does not come into play!!\n",
    "> 4. **I am having trouble reconstructing my optimal path. What should I do?** You can either try to keep track of where you came from and reconstruct the path by chaining parent information, or you can store entire paths in your frontier so that when you find the goal node you can just return the path found without having to do reconstruction.\n",
    "> 5. **Why does it say my path is invalid?** Did you return the path as a list of nodes including both the start and the goal node? Did you make sure that the path is a valid path and doesn't skip around? (Traverse the graph by hand to make sure it is valid)\n",
    "> 6. **Why does it say I'm exploring too many nodes?** Did you implement the optimization trick mentioned above? If so, are you making sure that you are not exploring any node more than once? You can check the set of nodes you've explored and how many times they've been explored by calling `graph.explored_nodes`. However please make sure that you remove this call from your code (not comment, fully remove) after you are done debugging as it will cause Gradescope to fail. If you wish to call it repeatedly, make sure you call `graph.reset_search()` to reset the explored count.\n",

    "## Exercise 1 - Bidirectional Uniform Cost Search [20pts]\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to reduce the number of nodes explored by the search process, we can instead use an alternative approach called **bidirectional search** to simultaneously search from the start and the goal nodes and hope that the two searches will meet in the middle (*AIMA 4th Ed. Section 3.4.5*). Implement bidirectional uniform cost search by completing the `bidirectional_ucs()` method in `submission/bi_ucs.py`. This function should return the path from the start node to the goal node (as a list of nodes).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stopping Conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "With Uniform Cost Search, we understand that every time a node is explored by a frontier, the shortest path to this node becomes known by the source from which it is explored from. Because of how frontiers are structured, we also know that any remaining paths on the frontier are guaranteed to have a true path cost of greater than or equal to the paths explored so far. Leveraging this information, we can intuitively conclude that when an intersection is found between the explored nodes of the forward search and the explored nodes of the backwards search, a path can be constructed through this common explored node to form a path between the start and the goal, and no further exploration will yield any paths that can possibly be shorter than this joined path (See page 130 of the [Ira Pohl paper](https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6601/assignment_1/blob/master/resources/Bi%20Directional%20A%20Star.pdf)). In other words, there is no need for further exploration or expansion of frontiers as it is impossible to find a shorter path through exploration than the one we have just created. An equivalent mathematical expression of this stopping condition would be to stop when $top_f + top_r > \\mu$ where $top_f$ is the current shortest unexplored path on the forward frontier, $top_r$ is the current shortest unexplored path on the backward (reverse) frontier, and $\\mu$ is the current shortest path found that connects the start and the goal (See slide 10 of the [Bi-Directional Slides](https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6601/assignment_1/blob/master/resources/Bi%20Directional%20A%20Star%20-%20Slides.pdf)).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, while the intersection of explored nodes guarantees that no further exploration is necessary, we can create pathological examples to show that the path through the intersection of explored nodes is not necessarily the shortest path, as seen in the scenario below (Via UCS, the start and the goal will meet and join a path at node A before exploring the direct path between the start and the goal. Clearly the joined path through node A is not the shortest path in this scenario).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"romania/pathological.png\" alt=\"pathological.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know for certain that no further exploration will yield components of the shortest path, then that must mean that the shortest path is already within the information that we have collected, and so a post-processing step is necessary for going through the information collected to find other candidate paths via crossover nodes, and checking each candidate path to ensure that we guarantee return of the shortest possible path. A past student example of how this post-processing step may proceed can be seen in [this provided resource](https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6601/assignment_1/blob/master/resources/Student%20Piazza%2017%20Example.pdf).\n",

    "Since there is no multithreading involved, a decision regarding the policy on expansion of the frontiers must be made. Do we alternate between forward and backward frontiers? Or do we expand the frontier with the minimum cost element on top? We leave this investigation up to the student, it may help to try both to see which one performs better with respect to the evaluation metrics.\n",

    "With the involvement of heuristics, the stopping condition from Bi-UCS can be further optimized so that we may stop earlier. Intuitively we understand that our stopping formula should reduce to an equivalent expression to that used in Bi-UCS above when the heuristic function returns zero, but what about the rest of the expression? According to [Rice and Tsotras](https://github.gatech.edu/omscs6601/assignment_1/blob/master/resources/Bi%20Directional%20A%20Star%20with%20Additive%20Approx%20Bounds.pdf), termination of the algorithm when $k_f + k_b \\geq \\mu + h_f(s)$ guarantees a shortest path, but what does this mean?\n",

But wait, it's not that simple! Paying careful attention to the syntax definitions from slides 14 through 16 we can see that $top_f$ and $top_r$ aren't simply the true path cost + admissible heuristic, instead its the true path cost + a customized expression of heuristics! Let us take a closer look at the syntax definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, $s$ and $t$ are the start and goal nodes respectively. $\\pi_f(v)$ is an estimate on the distance between node $v$ and $t$, a heuristic which is functionally equivalent to our euclidean heuristic measuring the distance from $v$ to the goal ($t$) for the forward search. Likewise, $\\pi_r(v)$ is an estimate on the distance between node $v$ and $s$, a heuristic from node $v$ to the start. We can easily see that $\\pi_f(s)$ and $\\pi_r(t)$ are equivalent, an estimate on the distance between the start and the goal. Looking at $top_f$ and $top_r$, we see:\n",

    "$d_f(v_f)$ and $d_r(v_r)$ are the true path costs from the start to the node $v_f$ and the goal to the node $v_r$ respectively, equivalent to our $g(n)$ term in standard A*. $p_f(v_f)$ and $p_r(v_r)$ replace our heuristic $h(n)$ term. Looking at their definitions on slide 15 we see:\n",

If the total length of the edge(s) of the shortest path connecting $v_f$ and $v_r$ are greater than this upper bound, then it is guaranteed that the path to be found is going to be larger than $\\mu$, hence we can stop and we won't be able to find anything new that is better than $\\mu$.\n",

    "Like bi-UCS, post-processing is also necessary to guarantee that the shortest path is selected as the stopping condition clearly does not reflect which path is shortest.

    "> 1. **Why can't I just run three bidirectional searches?** If you run three bidirectional searches, you aren’t taking advantage of the team knowledge collected by all the searches, and end up exploring multiple nodes, multiple times, blowing up your explored count. This is a team effort, all three goals should be searching for each other together, sharing information as necessary to prevent exploration of any node more than once.\n",
    "> 2. **Why can’t I just take the first two paths I find and call it a day?** Are you sure that’s guaranteed to be the most optimal path and the third path found is guaranteed to be larger than the two paths you’ve found? This could vary based on your implementation.\n",
    "> 3. **Why can’t I just find all three paths and then take the two shortest ones?** Are you sure you HAVE to find all three paths in order to pick the two shortest ones? You might end up exploring too many nodes in some cases…\n",
    "> 4. **Ok if I can’t do either of the above then what can I even do?** Is it really black and white? Is there really no in-between option?\n",
    "> 5. **How is it possible not to explore any node more than once when there are two searches?** The search is a team effort. All teammates are aware of each other’s knowledge so no node should ever have to be explored more than once.\n",
    "> 6. **Why are there no provided resources?** This is a thinking exercise. You are meant to build upon what you have learned so far from the assignment and to think about what a Tridirectional search brings to the table and how you can deal with those new issues and tricks.\n",

    "## Extra Credit - The Race\n",
    "\n",
    "When applying these search algorithms to road networks, we can often take advantage of the unique characteristics of road networks in the real world to improve the performance of the search algorithms. This optional exploration section provides students with the opportunity to explore advanced techniques on a **two-goal search** on the **Atlanta** map. It is called **the Race** because there is a leaderboard on Gradescope where you can compete against other students for bragging rights!\n",
    "\n",
    "To participate in **the Race**, implement `custom_search()` and any other functions you'd like in `submission/race.py` and submit both `submission/priority_queue.py` and `submission/race.py` to the Gradescope assignment called `Assignment 1race`. Recognize that this is optional, so it is not needed for the regular Assignment 1 submission (there is a separate Gradescope and a separate deadline for participating in the Race).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some techniques that we recommend you explore are:\n",
    "1. Landmarks (Pre-computing distances to known points of interest)\n",
    "2. Triangle-Inequality\n",
    "3. Shortcuts (Skipping nodes with low reach values)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Specific details will be posted on Edstem. Performance on this activity does not affect your grade.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> **FAQ**\n",
    "> 1. **What is the Haversine Distance Heuristic?** We have included the \"Haversine\" heuristic. All of the local tests on the Atlanta map use this method. For the race, you can use whatever you choose, but know that the Atlanta map positions are (latitude, longitude). If you would like to learn more about this formula, here is a link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula\n",
    "> 2. **How does `compute_landmarks` work?** `compute_landmarks` is optional and is a pre-processing function where we pass you the test graph and you can compute landmark information for it. The return value should be a `list` of **four** elements, and each element is suggested to contain an identifier for what that landmark is along with a map/dictionary kind of thing that contains information about each node's true path cost to that landmark. Do not call `compute_landmarks` within `custom_search` as that will blow up your explored count, instead call it in your pre-processing operation.\n",
    "> 3. **What is `load_data` for?** This is for your pre-processing operations. You can do things like call `compute_landmarks` to return landmark data or perform other techniques (i.e. computing shortcut information). The function will only be allowed to run for 10 minutes. The data you return will be input directly to `custom_search` and work done within `load_data` will not count towards your explored count as we will reset the graph upon completion of `load_data`.\n",

As a result, when you run the bidirectional tests in **_search_atlanta_tests.py_**, it generates a JSON file in the GeoJSON format.
