        Feel free to use this method to try and work with different heuristics and come up with a better search algorithm.

            u (str): Key for the first node to calculate from.
            v (str): Key for the second node to calculate to.

    Exercise 4: Upgraded Tridirectional Search

    See README.MD for exercise description.

    Args:
        graph (ExplorableGraph): Undirected graph to search.
        goals (list): Key values for the 3 goals
        heuristic: Function to determine distance heuristic.
